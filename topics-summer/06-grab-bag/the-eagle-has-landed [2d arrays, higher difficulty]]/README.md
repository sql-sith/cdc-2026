# One Small Step for Mankind, If Only We Can Land This Thing

You are piloting the lunar landing module in 1969, and the data telling you where to land, while state-of-the-art for the time, is coarse at best. You are given a grid of numbers (in Python: an array of arrays), representing potential landing spots for your rover. Find the safest landing spot based on the following rules:

* Each spot in the matrix will contain a number from `0-9`, inclusive.
* Any `0` represents a potential landing spot.
* Any number other than `0` is too dangerous to land. The higher the number, the more dangerous.
* The safest spot is defined as the `0` cell whose surrounding cells (up to 4 neighbors, ignore diagonals) have the lowest total danger.
* Ignore out-of-bounds neighbors (corners and edges just have fewer neighbors).
* Return the indices of the safest landing spot. There will always only be one safest spot.

For instance, given:

```py
[
  [1, 0],
  [2, 0]
]
```

Return `[0, 1]`, the indices for the `0` in the first array.

## Tests

1. `find_landing_spot([[1, 0], [2, 0]])` should return `[0, 1]`
2. `find_landing_spot([[9, 0, 3], [7, 0, 4], [8, 0, 5]])` should return `[1, 1]`.
3. `find_landing_spot([[1, 2, 1], [0, 0, 2], [3, 0, 0]])` should return `[2, 2]`.
4. `find_landing_spot([[9, 6, 0, 8], [7, 1, 1, 0], [3, 0, 3, 9], [8, 6, 0, 9]])` should return `[2, 1]`.

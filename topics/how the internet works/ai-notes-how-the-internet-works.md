Meeting notes:

* **IP Address Assignment and DHCP Process: **Chris led a detailed explanation of how a computer obtains an IP address via DHCP, describing the process from initial connection to network configuration, and discussed related concepts with the group including Eden and Dan.
  * **DHCP Server Interaction: **Chris described how a computer, upon connecting to a network, checks for an IP address and, if it does not have one, communicates with the DHCP server to obtain an IP address, default gateway, and DNS address. The process is automatic and occurs early during system startup, as seen in system logs.
  * **Network Connectivity Timing: **Chris explained that network connectivity is established as soon as the network driver is activated, whether the computer is plugged in or using wireless, and that the process is generally seamless unless there is a technical issue.
  * **DHCP Troubleshooting and Tools: **Later in the meeting, Chris and others discussed using tools like Wireshark and system commands to observe DHCP conversations, troubleshoot failures, and filter network traffic for DHCP packets, providing practical guidance for Linux and Windows environments.
* **DNS Resolution and Domain Name System: **Chris explained the role of DNS in converting domain names to IP addresses, using examples like reddit.com and databaseguy.com, and discussed caching, authoritative answers, and the global nature of DNS with the group.
  * **DNS Functionality: **Chris clarified that DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, which are necessary for network routing, and compared the process to looking up an address in a phone book.
  * **DNS Query and Caching: **The group discussed how a computer queries the DNS server for an IP address when visiting a domain for the first time, and how subsequent visits use cached results, with details on cache persistence across reboots in Windows and Linux.
  * **Authoritative and Non-Authoritative Answers: **Chris described the difference between authoritative and non-authoritative DNS responses, noting that in their example, the DNS server is assumed to have all necessary records cached for simplicity.
* **Routing, Default Gateway, and Network Segmentation: **Chris and the team discussed how computers determine whether a destination is on the local network or requires routing through a default gateway, using examples of local devices and public IP addresses, and introduced concepts like CIDR notation and subnet masks.
  * **Local vs. Remote Addressing: **Chris explained that if a destination IP shares the same network prefix as the local device, traffic is sent directly; otherwise, it is routed through the default gateway to reach external networks.
  * **CIDR Notation and Subnet Masks: **The group learned about CIDR notation (e.g., /24) and how subnet masks (e.g., 255.255.255.0) define which portion of an IP address represents the network, guiding routers in determining local versus remote addresses.
  * **Routing Process and Traceroute: **Chris described how routers forward packets through multiple hops to reach external destinations, and demonstrated the use of traceroute to visualize the path packets take across networks, including limitations when crossing ISP boundaries.
* **Binary Representation of IP Addresses: **Chris provided a step-by-step explanation of converting IP addresses from decimal to binary, illustrating how routers use binary comparison to determine network membership, and discussed octets and powers of two with the group.
  * **Decimal to Binary Conversion: **Chris walked through converting decimal numbers to binary, using examples like 10.0.2.11, and explained the significance of each binary digit in representing IP address octets.
  * **Network Address Comparison: **The group learned that routers compare the binary representation of IP addresses up to the length specified by the subnet mask or CIDR notation to determine if devices are on the same network.
  * **Practical Tools for Conversion: **Chris recommended using calculators or system utilities to convert decimal IP addresses to binary, emphasizing that understanding the concept is more important than manual calculation.
* **Virtual Machines, Hypervisors, and VSphere Setup: **Chris, Isaac, and others discussed plans for setting up virtual machines using VSphere and local hypervisors, outlined prerequisites for participants, and assigned tasks for preparing instructional materials and videos for the next sessions.
  * **VSphere and Hypervisor Overview: **The team discussed the use of VSphere for managing virtual machines, the disparity in hardware among participants, and the benefits of centralized resources for consistent performance.
  * **Preparation and Onboarding: **Chris and Isaac planned to provide instructional videos and documentation to help participants familiarize themselves with VSphere and virtual machine setup, including login procedures and basic interface navigation.
  * **Linux-Specific Considerations: **The group addressed special cases for Linux users, discussing options like LXC containers and the need for virtualization extensions, but ultimately recommended sticking with the centralized VSphere setup for simplicity.
  * **Task Assignments and Scheduling: **Isaac was assigned as the primary lead for the next two weeks of networking and VM setup sessions, with support from Oxl, and Chris agreed to source and share relevant instructional materials before the next meeting.
* **Memory Management and Swap in Linux: **Chris and others briefly discussed Linux memory management, including swap space, ZRAM, and hardware upgrade considerations, providing practical advice for optimizing system performance.
  * **Swap and ZRAM Usage: **Chris explained that systems with sufficient RAM (24GB or more) do not need swap space, and described ZRAM as a compressed memory solution that can provide additional virtual memory at the cost of CPU resources.

Follow-up tasks:

* **VSphere and VM Setup Preparation: **Find and share introductory videos on using VSphere and its interface to help participants familiarize themselves before the next session. (Chris)
* **VSphere and VM Setup Preparation: **Send out instructions and documentation for logging into Ice Age and setting up networking, including addressing proxy issues. (Chris)
* **VSphere and VM Setup Preparation: **Distribute a reminder to participants to watch the recommended video and ensure they can log into Ice Age before the next session. (Chris)
* **VSphere and VM Setup Preparation: **Review and share previous documentation from the repo on how to set up a VM with Ubuntu for the upcoming session. (Chris)
* **VSphere and VM Cleanup: **Send a direct message to former members to notify them that current VMs on VSphere will be deleted in two weeks and offer them the opportunity to download any needed data before removal. (Chris)

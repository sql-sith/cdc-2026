  * **Reducing Redundancy in Communication:** Chris discussed the possibility of removing duplicate links from Zulip to encourage team members to use the central portal, aiming to streamline communication and resource access.
* **Navigating and Using the Team GitHub Repository:** Chris guided the team, including Naomi and Axel, through accessing the team’s GitHub repository via the Octocat link on cdc2026.com, explaining how to find and use the cheat sheet and class notes, and demonstrating branch navigation and file access.
  * **Accessing GitHub via Octocat:** Chris instructed everyone to click the Octocat icon on cdc2026.com to access the team’s GitHub repository, emphasizing that this is the primary location for code, notes, and resources.
  * **Branch Navigation and File Access:** Chris explained how to use the 'code' tab and the branch dropdown to switch to the 'class notes rolling branch,' where sanitized class notes and cheat sheets are stored, and demonstrated how to open and download these files.
  * **Cheat Sheet and Class Notes Usage:** Chris described the contents and purpose of the cheat sheet (in markdown and PDF formats) and class notes, noting that the notes are sanitized to avoid giving away answers and are intended for ongoing reference.
  * **File Display and Download Options:** Chris clarified that markdown files display directly in GitHub, while PDFs can be downloaded for offline use, and reassured the team that these resources will remain available for future reference.
* **Bash Shell Basics and Directory Operations:** Chris led a hands-on session for the team on Bash shell basics, covering directory navigation, file creation, and essential commands such as mkdir, cd, ls, touch, rm, and rmdir, with live demonstrations and troubleshooting support for Naomi, Axel, and others.
  * **Setting Up the Bash Playground:** Chris instructed participants to create a dedicated directory called 'bash playground' using mkdir and to perform all worksheet activities within this directory to avoid affecting other parts of the file system.
  * **Directory Navigation and Shortcuts:** Chris demonstrated the use of cd, cd .., and cd (with no arguments) for directory navigation, explained the significance of the tilde (~) as the home directory, and highlighted tab completion for command and file names.
  * **File and Directory Creation:** Chris showed how to create files with touch and directories with mkdir, including nested directories using the -p (parents) option, and discussed the difference between creating empty files and updating timestamps.
  * **Listing and Inspecting Files:** Chris explained the use of ls with various options (e.g., -l, -a, -d) to list files, show hidden files, and display directory entries, and clarified the meaning of dot (.) and dot-dot (..) entries.
  * **Removing Files and Directories:** Chris covered the use of rm for files, rmdir for empty directories, and rm -rf for recursively and forcefully deleting non-empty directories, warning about the risks of using rm -rf.
* **Installing and Using TLDR for Command Reference:** Chris guided the team through installing the TLDR utility on Ubuntu, troubleshooting installation issues with Naomi and others, and demonstrated how TLDR provides concise command summaries compared to traditional man pages.
  * **TLDR Installation Process:** Chris instructed the team to update the package list with 'sudo apt update' and install TLDR using 'sudo apt install tldr,' assisting with password entry and addressing kernel upgrade prompts during installation.
  * **Troubleshooting Installation Issues:** Chris helped Naomi resolve a TLDR update failure caused by a missing .local/share/tldr directory, suggesting manual directory creation as a workaround.
  * **Updating TLDR Data:** Chris explained the need to run 'tldr --update' after installation to fetch the latest command summaries, and confirmed successful updates with the team.
  * **Comparing TLDR and Man Pages:** Chris demonstrated the difference between using 'man ls' (which provides lengthy, detailed documentation) and 'tldr ls' (which offers concise, practical examples), highlighting TLDR’s usefulness for quick reference.
* **File Permissions and chmod Usage:** Chris explained Linux file permissions, demonstrated how to interpret ls -l output, and guided the team through using chmod with both symbolic and numeric modes to modify file access, including restoring permissions after removal.
  * **Understanding File Permissions:** Chris broke down the meaning of the permission string in ls -l output, explaining the roles of user, group, and others, and the significance of read (r), write (w), and execute (x) bits.
  * **Exploring Ownership and Groups:** Chris discussed how files are owned by a user and associated with a group, using examples from /etc/shadow and highlighting differences in group assignments across distributions.
  * **Changing Permissions with chmod:** Chris demonstrated the use of chmod with symbolic notation (e.g., u+x, g-x, o=g) and numeric notation (e.g., 777 for all permissions, 000 for none), and explained the recursive option (-R) for directories.
  * **Restoring Permissions:** Chris showed how to restore read and write permissions to a file using 'chmod u+rw', emphasizing that file owners can always modify their own file permissions.
* **Text Editing and File Viewing Utilities:** Chris introduced the team to text editing with nano and file viewing with cat, head, tail, more, and less, providing practical exercises and highlighting the differences and use cases for each tool.
  * **Editing Files with Nano:** Chris instructed the team to use nano for editing files, explained basic controls (e.g., Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit), and assigned an exercise to enter nursery rhymes or song names into a file.
  * **Viewing Files with cat:** Chris explained the use of cat to display file contents, discussed the origin of the command name (concatenate), and demonstrated its use for both short and long files.
  * **Paging Large Files:** Chris demonstrated the use of head and tail to view the beginning and end of files, and compared more and less for paging through large files, noting that less is more responsive for streaming output.
* **Searching, Filtering, and Sorting Text Data:** Chris taught the team to use grep, wc, sort, and uniq for searching, counting, sorting, and deduplicating text data, including practical examples and explanations of pipelines and regular expressions.
  * **Searching with grep:** Chris explained the use of grep for searching text within files, demonstrated basic and advanced options (e.g., -n for line numbers, -l for matching files, -i for case insensitivity), and introduced the concept of regular expressions for complex searches.
  * **Counting with wc:** Chris showed how to use wc to count lines, words, and characters in files, and demonstrated combining grep and wc with a pipeline to count matching lines.
  * **Sorting and Deduplication:** Chris demonstrated the use of sort for ordering file contents, including human-readable sorting with the -h option, and explained how uniq removes duplicate lines from sorted input, emphasizing the Unix philosophy of single-purpose utilities.
  * **Using Pipelines:** Chris described how to use the pipe (|) operator to chain commands, sending the output of one command as input to another, and provided examples combining grep, sort, and uniq.

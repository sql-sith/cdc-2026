Date: November 1, 2025
Presenter: Chris

## Discussion Notes

* **Centralized Resource and Communication Hub Setup:** Chris introduced the new cdc2026.com website as a centralized hub for the Cyber Defense Club, explaining its purpose to Haddon and others, and walked through how to access key resources such as GitHub, Zulip, Discord, Teams, and YouTube, with discussion on how to pin and share these links for easy access among team members and parents.
  * **Website Overview and Purpose:** Chris described the cdc2026.com site as a one-stop resource for team members and parents, providing direct links to essential platforms including GitHub, Zulip, Discord, Teams, and YouTube. The site is designed to be easily accessible and bookmarkable, with both dashed and non-dashed URLs redirecting to the same location.
  * **Resource Link Management:** Chris explained how the site includes all relevant URLs, and discussed with Haddon the importance of matching the dash in the URL to the GitHub repository name for consistency. The team agreed to advertise the dashed version but maintain both for convenience.
  * **Pinning and Sharing Links:** Chris and Haddon explored options for pinning important topics and links in Zulip and Teams, considering how to make resources like the website and Teams link easily discoverable for all members, and discussed the limitations and features of the platform's pinning and starring functionalities.
  * **Parent and Team Member Accessibility:** Chris emphasized the utility of the site for parents who cannot access Zulip, ensuring they can stay informed about club activities and resources, and confirmed with Dan that the link was added to the resources channel for broader visibility.
* **GitHub Repository and Wiki Usage:** Chris led a walkthrough of the club's GitHub repository, explaining to Haddon and Axel how to join, access, and contribute, and detailed the use of the GitHub wiki for frequently changing information, technical documentation, and collaborative editing, including search techniques and version history management.
  * **Joining and Accessing the Repository:** Chris guided Haddon through the process of creating a GitHub account, joining the public repository, and accessing it via the website link, clarifying that an account is required for contributions but not for viewing public content.
  * **Wiki Functionality and Best Practices:** Chris explained the role of the GitHub wiki for storing frequently changing information, such as IP address assignments and hackathon URLs, and highlighted its advantages for collaborative editing, version history, and rollback capabilities without requiring pull requests.
  * **Search Techniques in GitHub:** Chris demonstrated the differences between searching within the wiki and the broader repository, showing how to use the slash command for comprehensive searches and clarifying the limitations of the page title search in the wiki interface.
  * **Documentation and Process Management:** Chris discussed the types of documentation suitable for the wiki versus the repository, and outlined the use of other tools like JIRA for process management, emphasizing the importance of placing static or frequently updated information in the wiki for team accessibility.
* **Windows Server VM Creation and Configuration in vSphere:** Chris provided step-by-step instructions to Haddon and the team on creating and configuring Windows Server virtual machines in vSphere, covering naming conventions, storage selection, disk provisioning, ISO mounting, and troubleshooting common setup issues.
  * **VM Creation Workflow:** Chris walked Haddon through the process of creating a new Windows Server VM, including selecting the correct folder (school 14), choosing the appropriate storage pool, and ensuring the VM is named for easy identification.
  * **Disk Provisioning and ISO Mounting:** Chris emphasized the importance of selecting thin provisioning for the virtual disk to avoid exhausting storage resources, and guided the team in mounting the correct Windows Server ISO from the data store, ensuring the 'connect at power on' option is enabled.
  * **Troubleshooting Boot and Console Issues:** Chris addressed common boot issues such as EFI network timeouts, instructing the team on using the web console and the control-alt-delete function to trigger a proper boot from the ISO, and discussed browser compatibility for accessing vSphere.
  * **Installation Steps and User Prompts:** Chris and Haddon navigated the Windows installation prompts together, selecting the correct edition and experience, handling disk selection, and clarifying the difference between upgrade and clean install options.
* **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Setup and Multi-User Access:** Chris instructed Haddon and the team on enabling and configuring Remote Desktop on Windows Server VMs, troubleshooting connection issues, managing user accounts, and demonstrating simultaneous multi-user access and session limits.
  * **Enabling Remote Desktop:** Chris guided Haddon through accessing remote desktop settings on the target VM, enabling the feature, and confirming the necessary settings for remote connections, including making the PC discoverable.
  * **Connection Troubleshooting:** Chris and Haddon resolved issues with failed RDP connections by verifying IP addresses, adjusting firewall settings, and ensuring remote desktop was properly enabled, ultimately achieving successful connections between VMs.
  * **User Account Creation and Permissions:** Chris demonstrated how to create new user accounts on the Windows Server VM, set appropriate password policies, and add users to the list of allowed remote desktop users, ensuring proper access control.
  * **Multi-User Session Management:** Chris and Haddon tested simultaneous RDP sessions, observed session limits, and used Task Manager to view active users, explaining the two-session limit for standard Windows Server and the licensing requirements for Remote Desktop Server mode.
* **Meeting Logistics and Scheduling:** Chris and Haddon discussed the meeting schedule, break times, and plans for the Python coding session, confirming timing and participant availability for the afternoon segment.
  * **Session Timing and Breaks:** Chris coordinated with Haddon on the timing for the Python session, agreed on a 10-minute break, and confirmed the session would run until 1:30 to accommodate Haddon’s schedule.

## Follow-up tasks:

* **Resource Page Updates:** Add the cdc2026.com URL (with and without dash) to the Zulip resources channel and ensure it is pinned for easy access. (Chris)
* **GitHub Access:** Create a GitHub account and notify Chris to receive an invitation to join the team repository. (haddon)
* **Credential Management:** Ensure all team members have access to the correct credentials for vSphere and document the process for future reference. (Chris)
* **Windows VM Documentation Review:** Review and update the Windows VM setup documentation to clarify missing network settings such as DNS or gateway. (Chris)
* **Server Shutdown Procedure:** Reopen VM tabs and properly shut down Windows virtual machines from within the operating system to avoid resource issues. (haddon)

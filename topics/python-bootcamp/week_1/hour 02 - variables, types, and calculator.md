# ðŸ•‘ Hour 2: Variables, Types, and the Hacker Calculator

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Learn how to store and manipulate data
* Understand basic types and conversions
* Practice arithmetic operations
* Explore dynamic code execution and its risks

## ðŸ§± Topics Covered

* `input()`, `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
* Variable assignment
* Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
* `type()` inspection
* `eval()` and its dangers

## ðŸ§ª Activities

1. ### Simple Calculator

   ```python
   a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
   b = float(input("Enter second number: "))
   print("Sum:", a + b)
   print("Difference:", a - b)
   print("Product:", a * b)
   print("Quotient:", a / b)
   ```

   âœ… *Checkpoint:* What happens if you enter a word instead of a number? How could you prevent that?

2. ### Eval-Based Expression Runner

   ```python
   expr = input("Enter a math expression: ")
   result = eval(expr)
   print("Result:", result)
   ```

   âœ… *Checkpoint:* What does `eval()` do? Try entering `3 + 4`, then `__import__('os').system('echo HACKED')`. Whatâ€™s the risk?

3. ### Log File With a Mysterious Line

   ```python
   print("2025-10-24 23:51:02 INFO User login: eve")
   print("2025-10-24 23:51:11 INFO User eve opening email\033[30;40mDEBUG Injected payload: -- pretend eve runs a dangerous command here -- \033[0m")
   print("2025-10-24 23:51:15 INFO Session terminated")
   ```

   âœ… *Checkpoint:* At your job, you find these three log messages for a session by a user named eve.

   * Can you figure out what all of those strange characters at the beginning and end of her log message are for?
   * If this log were printed in the way Eve expects, critical information would be hidden. How do we make sure that hackers can't use tricks like this to fool us?

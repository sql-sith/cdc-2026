## IT Club Cyber Defense, 2025-2025 season

This repository holds meeting notes, source code, and other key resources for our club. Here's a quick guide for where things belong:

* Discussions? Use Zulip.
* Process-related and tracked in Jira? Keep it in Jira.
* Permanent documentation? Put it somewhere easy to find:
  * Meeting notes → /topics folder. Create a subfolder per topic.
  * How-to guides → Add to the Wiki.
  * Frequently updated info → Use the Wiki instead of Zulip. If a Zulip thread would get long due to constant updates, a Wiki page is better—just update the page and skip the comment clutter.

## Resources

In addition to this GitHub repo, we use a few other platforms throughout the year. Up-to-date links are on the [Wiki](https://github.com/sql-sith/cdc-2026/wiki).

### Zulip

Our main chat and coordination hub. Think **Slack**, with threads that actually work.

**✅ Action:** Install Zulip on your phone or laptop and turn on notifications. Pay close attention to the *announcements* and *meetings and homework* streams.

### ISERink / ISEAGE

Virtual machine platforms hosted by Iowa State — basically the Internet in a bottle.

* **ISERink**: Used for class.
* **ISEAGE**: Used during competitions.

### Discord

Iowa State runs a Discord server where you can ask questions or chat with **Innovate IT** staff and other students. Once you join, you’ll get access to their support channels.

### Teams

We use Microsoft Teams for meetings when Chris is available. Recordings go to YouTube, and any class materials (including AI-generated notes) get posted here under `/topics`.

### YouTube

Our YouTube channel hosts meeting recordings. They're unedited - faster to post, easier to search. YouTube auto-generates transcripts, so you can search for keywords and jump straight to the part you need.
